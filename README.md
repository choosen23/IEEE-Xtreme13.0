# Problems
The official site of IEEE-Xtreme 13.0 is at <a href="https://csacademy.com/ieeextreme13/tasks/">CS Academy</a> but I am positive sure that the problems are going to be at Hackerank site in IEEE-Xtreme practise page <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/ieeextreme-challenges/">here</a>


# License
Turns out all the entries submitted during IEEEXtreme 13.0 become the property of IEEE, so I suppose these solutions belong to them.The problem statements belong entirely to IEEEXtreme, they were simply copy-and-pasted and had some Markdown formatting put back in.
